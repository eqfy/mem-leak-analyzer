# Milestones

## Milestone 1

### Progress So Far
We discussed as a group and brainstormed about 10+ ideas for our project. Some of them were either lacking in complexity, or too complex. With the help of our TA, we eliminated ones not worth pursuing. What resulted is a list of 4 ideas that we are going to flush out and decide which to progress forward with. The ideas are listed below:

1. Create a static linter with a specific use case in mind (similar to ESLINT, for example. But a linter with rules that we create from scratch)
2. Create a static path visualizer that displays to users the different paths a program can take (for example, and IF statement would result in two paths). Then statically provide the user with a set of inputs that would allow the program to navigate down a path they chose.
3. Create a static checker to (estimate) memory related issues in C or C++
4. Create a static checker to (estimate) certain dynamic errors that could occcur (choose either super easy ones, or choose a single dynamic error and focus on that, as the anaylsis is non-trivial and difficult)

### Planned follow-up tasks for the next week.
1. Discuss our ideas further and finalize our idea
2. Scope our project very concretely
3. Mockup a sample program that our project should be able to analyze
4. Describe the desired output that our project should produce for said program
5. User study, if possible
