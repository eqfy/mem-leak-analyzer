## Project description, motivation, use-case, and target users
In a nutshell, our program analysis attempts to statically estimate memory loss within a given C file. This includes producing errors for memory that is definitely lost: memory that is lost in all possible paths the program could take. As well as producing warnings for memory that is possibly lost: memory that is lost in >= 1 paths that the program could take.

The motivation behind this is quite obviously to help programmers reduce silly memory leaks which commonly occur when writing code in C. Memory leaks are bad because they block memory resources and degrade program performance over time, hence reducing the possibility of memory leaks poses a huge benefit for developers.

Given the relative simplicity of our analysis and scope, our tool would be most useful to beginner C programmers, especially those taking CPSC 213. They could use this tool to help reduce errors in their assignments or small programs they are creating, as well as leverage it as a way of learning and reinforcing the importance of memory management in C. However, expanding on this idea and increasing the accuracy, complexity, and scope of this project, could easily result in a tool that all programmers, regardless of skill level, could benefit from


## Why static C memory-loss analysis?
Memory loss is obviously an issue
